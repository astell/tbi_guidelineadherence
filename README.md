# TBI Guideline Adherence

This project measures the adherence of TBI ICU datasets against the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines. There are three modules to the code: the first is an online web application that runs the adherence measurements, the second and third are a EUSIG event conversion tool and a "live observer" analysis code of a previous TBI analysis project [reference]. Both are standalone Java applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The following software must be installed in order to run these applications. Tomcat and MySQL are required for the ICUChart web application.

```
Java JRE (v7 or above)
Apache Tomcat (v7 or above)
MySQL (v5.5 or above)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
